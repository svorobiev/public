ENFORCEMENT
It is the responsibility of each owner to know the terms and provisions of the Declaration, By-laws and Rules 
and Regulations of the Association.
Each owner is responsible for advising tenants or guests of the owner of any provision of the Declaration, Bylaws or Rules & Regulations that apply to them. These Rules and Regulations are provided as a supplement to 
the Declaration and By-laws and are not meant to relieve any owner from the obligation to know the 
provisions of the Declaration and By-laws. Owners shall also comply with all statutes, ordinances and 
requirements of all municipal, state and federal authorities now in force or which may hereafter be in force, 
pertaining to the use of the Condominium.
Each owner, tenant, or occupant of a unit shall comply with the provisions of the Declaration, By-laws, and 
Rules and Regulations of the Association, as they may be amended from time to time, and with all decisions 
made by the Board or the Association pursuant thereto. Failure to comply shall be grounds for an action to 
recover sums due, damages, or injunctive relief, or any or all of them, maintainable by the Board, the 
Association’s managing agent on its behalf, or by the aggrieved owner.
To enforce the Rules and Regulations, the Board may also levy monetary fines. The Board may give written 
notice of the violation, and state a reasonable period of time for correcting the violation. If the violation is 
not corrected within the time stated, the Board may itself make the correction, and any costs incurred in 
connection wherewith shall be imposed on the unit owner and added to the monthly maintenance fee for 5
the first month following the correction. Payment of such costs shall be enforced in the same manner as is 
provided for the enforcement of maintenance fees.
Prior to taking any enforcement action (other than the initial notice of violation), the Board will give the 
owner involved written notice. The notice shall include (a) a statement of the offense, (b) the proposed 
action and/or fine.
a. The offending owner may request a hearing before the Board or a specially appointed committee or 
representative regarding the proposed action or fine. Written request must be received via USPS to the 
Property Management, or email to a board member within 10 business days of mailing. 
b. At the hearing, the affected owner shall have the right to give testimony as outlined in the notice, subject 
to reasonable rules of procedure established by the Board to assure a prompt and orderly resolution of the 
issue at hand.
c. Evidence presented at the hearing shall be considered in making the decision regarding fines or other 
enforcement action.
d. The affected owner shall be notified of the decision in the same manner in which notice of the meeting 
was given. In addition, the Board can take any other legal action appropriate or remedy or penalize a 
violation of these Rules, the By-laws or the Condominium Declaration. In enforcing these rules, the Board 
may delegate its function(s), including the determination of whether a violation has occurred, and the 
remedy therefore, to an agent, including but not limited to a single, or group of, director(s) or officers, or the 
property manager. Owners shall be financially responsible for all damages caused by their tenants or guest, 
and for any fines imposed as the result of conduct on the part of their tenants, guests or invitees. Any charge 
for damages or fines shall be imposed against the unit, itself, in which the party responsible rented or was 
visiting, and shall be enforceable in the same manner as is provided for the enforcement of maintenance 
fees.
